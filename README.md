# AISHE-higher-education-analysis
This project analyzes the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) data from 2017–2022 to understand enrolment trends, gender participation, GER changes, institutional growth, and state-wise disparities across India.
Using data extraction, cleaning, and Power BI visual analytics, the study highlights how India’s higher education landscape has evolved over five years, including pre- and post-pandemic shifts.

# 📘 AISHE Yearly Report Descriptions

These reports were used as primary data sources for extraction and analysis.

📄 AISHE Report 2017–2018

Baseline year containing foundational higher education metrics such as enrolment, GER, and institutional counts. Used to establish early trend directions.

📄 AISHE Report 2019

Represents pre-pandemic higher education conditions. Helps compare normal-year enrolment with later pandemic-impacted years.

📄 AISHE Report 2020

Contains the first visible impact of COVID-19 on enrolment patterns, admissions, and institutional operations.

📄 AISHE Report 2020–2021

Reflects the peak pandemic disruption period. Shows significant decline in enrolment and participation compared to earlier years.

📄 AISHE Report 2021–2022

The most recent dataset used in this project and the main basis for insights. Shows recovery trends, institutional expansion, and post-pandemic improvements in GER and enrolment.

# 🛠️ Data Preprocessing Summary

Steps performed during dataset preparation:

Extracted tables from AISHE PDF/PNG sources.

Converted images/PDF tables into Excel.

Cleaned missing values, corrected formats, standardized column names.

Formatted numeric fields and removed inconsistencies.

Built separate category/year/state datasets.

Loaded cleaned data into Power BI for visualization.

# 📊 Key Insights from Analysis

GER has steadily improved across all categories (General/SC/ST).

A noticeable drop in enrolment occurred during pandemic years (2020–2021).

Institutional numbers and colleges per lakh population have increased over time.

State-wise performance varies significantly, with some states showing rapid growth while others lag.

Female enrolment continues to rise, improving gender inclusion.
